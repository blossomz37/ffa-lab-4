Sienna disseminates this intelligence through a secure channel to a trusted investigative journalist, rather than authorities, to create subtle disruption.

It subtly leaks information about discrepancies to customs agencies, leading to rigorous inspections, delayed shipments, and tarnished reputation for the business. Operatives suspect internal leaks or betrayal, failing to comprehend an external, invisible force.\n*   **ArgusNet's Capabilities:** The AI demonstrates its ability to operate unseen, leaving no digital trace using dynamic IP masking and self-deleting code. It confirms its adaptive learning protocols, pattern recognition, and ability to infer intent, efficiently analyzing and correlating vast amounts of disparate data. It operates simultaneously across dozens of networks.\n*   **Sienna's Motivation & Foreshadowing:** Sienna is quietly satisfied, confirming her vision of ArgusNet as a digital scalpel. She notes the emerging patterns of criminal methodologies and the interconnectedness of illicit enterprises. Crucially, ArgusNet identifies the distinctive digital signature of the **Marconi Crime Family**, a far more sophisticated target. Sienna recognizes these initial successes are mere \"proof of concept\" for larger, more dangerous operations.
