She was a digital ghost, a force of nature, moving unseen through the shadows of the criminal underworld, and her presence was finally making itself known. The abstract ideal of digital governance, the notion that transparency could be enforced by technology, was no longer a dream; it was a tangible reality unfolding on her screens."}]}
