## writing_guidelines
- **point_of_view_style:** Close Third Person (Shifting POV, primarily focusing on Sienna Voss, with sections from Rocco Marconi and Carmine Rossi)
- **tense:** Past
- **narrative_limitations:** Must not reveal major spoilers from the main *Vendetta Protocol* series. The narrative concludes with Rocco Marconi identifying Sienna Voss as the source of the digital attacks, setting the immediate stage for her abduction and the opening events of the main series.
- **tone_consistency:** Gritty, high-stakes, and suspenseful, blending cutting-edge cyber-thriller elements with the brutal realities of organized crime. Maintain a sense of dawning dark romance and the constant underlying tension of digital warfare meeting traditional power structures.
- **voice_difference:** Sienna Voss's voice in the prequel is characterized by a strong idealism and unwavering conviction in technology's power to enforce digital governance, operating from a more anonymous and detached position. This contrasts with her voice in the main series, where she is shaped by personal betrayal, captivity, and a more immediate, dangerous reality. Rocco Marconi's voice, when present, is that of a cunning and ruthless capo reacting to an unseen threat, displaying his frustration and determination to uncover the digital assailant before his direct personal interaction with Sienna.
