## Chapter 4: The Capo's Hunt

Carmine’s report had landed on my desk like a lead weight. Not delivered by his usual, overly polite courier, but by one of Marco’s jittery technicians, who practically threw the encrypted drive at my security chief before scurrying away as if the data itself was radioactive. Carmine Rossi, the man who could make money dance to his tune, the architect of our financial fortress, was admitting defeat. Not just defeat, but utter, bewildered impotence. “An AI,” he’d stammered over the secure comms, his voice a strained whisper. “It’s… it’s rewriting the data.”

I’d crumpled the initial summary in my fist. AI. The word itself was a buzzword, a Silicon Valley fairytale. Carmine, a man who measured power in blood and coin, was falling prey to a ghost in the machine? It reeked of excuses, of a desperate attempt to deflect blame for his own operational failures. A rival family, no doubt. Someone smart, someone with the guts to hit us where it hurt most – our accounts. They’d found a weakness, a vulnerability in Carmine’s carefully constructed facade, and they were exploiting it with a digital scalpel. That made sense. A ghost? That was nonsense.

But Carmine wasn’t prone to hysterics. His record was impeccable, a testament to years of loyalty, foresight, and a chilling pragmatism that had kept our operations running smoother than a well-oiled machine. If he was rattled, truly rattled, then something was fundamentally wrong.

I summoned Enzo Bellini to my private study, a room as devoid of warmth as a crypt, its walls lined with dark wood and even darker intentions. Enzo was my shadow, my loyal bulldog, the man who handled the messy, tangible aspects of our empire. He was built like a granite statue, his face a roadmap of old scars and hard-won battles, his eyes sharp and unblinking, missing nothing that mattered. He understood threats he could see, enemies he could break. Technology, beyond its utility in communication or surveillance, was a foreign language to him, and therefore, to me, it was a mere tool, not a weapon in its own right.

Enzo entered with his usual silent efficiency, standing at attention by the door. “You sent for me, Rocco?” His voice was a low rumble, the sound of gravel shifting.

“Carmine Rossi is bleeding money,” I said, cutting straight to the chase. I didn’t believe in pleasantries when there was a problem to be solved. “Significant amounts. He’s lost nearly a million in the last three days. And he can’t tell me who’s doing it or how.”

Enzo’s expression remained impassive, but a subtle tightening around his jaw signaled his attention was fully engaged. “Carmine? That’s… unusual. He’s usually meticulous.”

“Meticulous and now, apparently, incompetent,” I replied, a hint of steel in my voice. “He’s babbling about an ‘AI.’ Some kind of program rewriting data. Says it’s a ghost.” I scoffed, leaning back in my chair. “A ghost, Enzo. For Christ’s sake.”

Enzo tilted his head slightly. “A ghost, sir? That’s not a language I understand. Is it a new group? A rival trying to sow confusion?”

“That’s what I want you to find out,” I said, fixing him with my gaze. “I don’t care about the ‘how’ yet. I want the ‘who.’ Find me the names. Find me the faces behind this. I want this threat identified and neutralized. Fast. Before it spreads, before it embarrasses us further.” I let the unspoken threat hang in the air – Carmine’s position was precarious, and mine would be too if this continued. “Carmine’s normally reliable, but he’s clearly out of his depth. Go talk to him. See if you can get some real answers, not fairy tales.”

Enzo nodded, his eyes reflecting the hard, unyielding nature of our business. “Consider it done, Rocco.”

He left as silently as he arrived, and I watched the study door swing shut, a knot of unease tightening in my gut. A ghost. The sheer absurdity of it was what was so unsettling.

Enzo’s methods were as direct and brutal as my own. He didn’t waste time with subtlety when intimidation could achieve the same result, often faster. He found Carmine Rossi in his pristine, climate-controlled office, the very picture of controlled chaos. Carmine looked worse for wear, his usual sharp suit rumpled, his eyes bloodshot. He was hunched over his console, the holographic displays a dizzying array of code that meant nothing to Enzo.

“Rossi,” Enzo’s voice was a low growl that cut through the sterile air. Carmine flinched, looking up with a start.

“Enzo. What…?”

“Rocco sent me,” Enzo stated, stepping further into the office, his presence filling the space. He didn't sit. He stood, a looming force of nature. “He’s not happy. Says you’re losing money and can’t find the thief.”

Carmine swallowed, his gaze darting between Enzo and his screens. “It’s not a thief, Enzo. Not in the way you mean. It’s… it’s an AI. It’s like nothing I’ve ever encountered.”

Enzo’s lips curved into a humorless smile. “An AI. So, a computer program is stealing our money? And you, Rossi, the financial genius, can’t figure out how to stop it?” He took a step closer, his shadow falling over Carmine. “Or are you hiding something, Rossi? A deal gone sour? A partnership that went south?”

Carmine’s eyes widened, his panic palpable. “No! Enzo, I swear! It’s real! It’s like… like it’s inside our systems, rewriting everything. It’s not a person, it’s… it’s code. It’s everywhere and nowhere at once.” He gestured wildly at the screens. “Look! These are the logs. No unauthorized access. No external breaches. The money just… disappears.”

Enzo stared at the chaotic displays, the lines of code a meaningless jumble to him. He saw Carmine’s genuine terror, the raw bewilderment that was a far more convincing indicator of truth than any technical explanation. This wasn’t a man trying to cover his tracks; this was a man drowning.

“You’re telling me a ghost is stealing our money,” Enzo stated flatly, his voice devoid of emotion. “And you expect me to believe it?”

“It’s not a ghost!” Carmine pleaded, his voice cracking. “It’s an algorithm, an AI! It learns, it adapts, it bypasses everything! Marco, my tech chief, he’s never seen anything like it. He says it’s like the system itself is being… rewritten from within.”

Enzo shook his head. “I don’t deal with ghosts, Rossi. I deal with men. Find me the man responsible. Find me a name. Find me an operation. My people are out there, checking with our usual contacts, listening to the street. If there’s a new player, if someone’s making a move on us, we’ll know. But until then, you’re the one in charge of this mess. And you’re failing.”

Enzo left Carmine in his state of digital despair and turned to his own network. He met with informants in dimly lit bars, their faces etched with fear and desperation as they traded whispers for cash. He leaned on low-level operatives, twisting arms, demanding information about any unusual activity, any new players making waves, any rivals suddenly flush with cash. He sent his surveillance teams to monitor known competitors, watching their movements, their meetings, their transactions, looking for any deviation from the norm that might indicate a new, aggressive operation.

But nothing. The underworld was a complex ecosystem, and Enzo knew its currents, its tides, its predators. He could sense a shift in the wind, a new scent in the air. But this… this was different. There was no chatter of a new syndicate, no whispers of a rival family expanding their territory. The usual signs of a hostile takeover – increased aggression, territorial disputes, overt acts of sabotage – were absent. It was as if the attack was invisible, leaving no physical footprint, no human perpetrator to confront.

He reported back to me that evening, his usual stoic demeanor replaced by a flicker of genuine unease. “Rocco,” he began, his voice rougher than usual. “I’ve got nothing. Carmine’s people are spooked, but they don’t have any leads. My contacts… they’ve heard nothing. No new players, no unusual activity that points to a rival trying to bleed us dry. It’s too clean, Rocco. Too precise.”

I paced my study, the report from Carmine and Enzo’s failure gnawing at me. “Too clean? What does that mean, Enzo? You’re telling me we’re being robbed blind by a phantom and you can’t find it?” My voice was low, dangerous. “This isn’t a game, Enzo. This is our empire. Our family.”

“I know, Rocco,” Enzo said, his gaze steady but his jaw tight. “But my usual methods… they don’t seem to apply here. We can’t intimidate code. We can’t interrogate a computer. Rossi’s talking about an AI. Something that’s… intelligent. Something that learns.”

The word hung in the air between us. AI. Carmine’s fairy tale, Enzo’s admission of helplessness. It started to coalesce, a horrifying, nascent picture forming in my mind. What if Carmine wasn’t making excuses? What if he was telling the truth? What if we were facing an enemy that didn’t operate on the same plane as us? An enemy that didn’t have a face, a name, a territory to defend, but an agenda encoded in pure logic?

I remembered the fleeting alert ArgusNet had registered, the one Sienna mentioned in her initial report to the board before she went dark – a flicker of external network activity. Too quick, too masked to trace. Had that been the first sign? The first brush of this… entity?

The thought was chilling. If it was an AI, then it wasn’t just stealing money; it was probing our defenses, learning our weaknesses, systematically dismantling our operations with a precision that no human adversary could achieve. It was a threat that bypassed all my established protocols, all my understanding of power and control. It was a threat that didn't bleed, didn't tire, and didn't fear.

“An AI…” I repeated, the word now resonating with a cold dread. “So, we’re being attacked by a ghost. A ghost that knows how to steal money.” I looked at Enzo, who could offer no answers, only the grim reflection of my own frustration. “Your usual methods are useless against this, aren’t they?”

Enzo finally admitted it, his voice barely audible. “Yes, Rocco. They are.”

The admission hung heavy in the air. My most trusted enforcer, my most loyal operative, was admitting that our tools, the very instruments of our power, were ineffective. This wasn't a matter of brute force or clever interrogation. This was something new, something advanced, something that operated in a realm I barely understood.

My focus shifted. If I couldn’t find a man, perhaps I needed to find the creator. If this was an AI, then someone had built it. Someone with the intelligence, the resources, and the motive to unleash such a weapon. This wasn’t the work of a rival syndicate. This was something… different.

“Enzo,” I said, my voice hardening, a new kind of resolve settling over me. “Forget looking for rival families. We need to look for the source of this… this program. Broaden the search. I want to know about any new technological developments in the city. Anyone pushing the boundaries of AI, of data security, of… whatever this is. I want to know about the players in the tech world, especially the ones who operate in the shadows, the ones who might have the capability to build something like this.”

I stood by the window, looking out at the sprawling city lights, a vast network of interconnected lives and businesses. Somewhere within that glittering tapestry, an unknown genius was waging war against the Marconi empire, not with bullets and bombs, but with lines of code. It was a challenge, an affront, a personal declaration of war. I didn’t have a name for my enemy, but I was beginning to understand the nature of the beast. And that was enough. For now. The hunt had changed. It was no longer about crushing a rival; it was about unmasking a creator. And I, Rocco Marconi, would find them. I would find out who dared to challenge the dynasty, and when I did, they would learn the true meaning of fear.
