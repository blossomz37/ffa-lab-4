# Next Steps for Writing Style Fine-tuning Project

## Your Tasks:

1. ✓ **Set up the environment**
   - ✓ Run the master setup script to prepare the directory structure:
     ```bash
     bash master_setup.sh
     ```
   - ✓ Make sure all scripts are executable

2. ✓ **Configure API access**
   - ✓ Create a .env file in the project root
   - ✓ Add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```
   - ✓ Test API access by running the dataset preparation script

3. ✓ **Review source material**
   - ✓ Ensure all necessary source materials are in the `/original documents` folder
   - ✓ Consider adding any additional writing samples if available (character sheets, dialogue examples, etc.)

4. ✓ **Prepare training data**
   - ✓ Run the dataset preparation script:
     ```bash
     python scripts/prepare_dataset.py
     ```
   - ✓ Review the generated datasets in the `datasets` directory:
     - ✓ `training_finetune_dataset.jsonl`
     - ✓ `validation_finetune_dataset.jsonl`
   - ✓ Check the console output for pattern extraction statistics

5. ✓ **Review examples by category**
   - ✓ Examine dialogue patterns and speaker attribution
   - ✓ Check narrative passages for plot development
   - ✓ Verify descriptive writing samples
   - ✓ Ensure balance across categories

6. ✓ **Review JSON format**
   - ✓ Check that each example follows the format:
     ```json
     {
       "messages": [
         {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
         {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
         {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
       ]
     }
     ```
   - ✓ Verify proper JSON formatting and escape characters

7. ✓ **Organize new writing samples**
   - ✓ Add new source materials to `original documents` as needed
   - ✓ Rerun dataset preparation with new samples
   - ✓ Compare datasets for improved coverage

## Next Steps:

1. ✓ **Fine-tuning Implementation**
   - ✓ Submit datasets for fine-tuning
   - ✓ Monitor fine-tuning progress
   - ✓ Test fine-tuned model
   - ✓ Document model information

2. **Future Improvements**
   - Expand the testing suite with more diverse prompts
   - Create a more comprehensive evaluation framework
   - Add examples of successful outputs to documentation
   - Consider additional fine-tuning runs with expanded datasets

3. **Usage Documentation**
   - Create example scripts for common use cases
   - Document best practices for prompt engineering
   - Add troubleshooting guides
   - Create a model performance evaluation guide

## Completed Milestones:

1. ✓ **Initial setup**: Completed
2. ✓ **Dataset preparation**: Completed
3. ✓ **Fine-tuning**: Successfully completed with model ID `ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:personal::C2OM1LSz`
4. ✓ **Testing**: Initial tests successful

Tips:
- Start with a small set of high-quality writing samples
- Review extracted patterns before generating the full dataset
- Add more samples incrementally to improve coverage
