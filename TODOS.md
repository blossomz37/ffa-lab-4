# Next Steps for Vendetta Protocol Finetuning Project

## Your Tasks:

1. **Set up the environment**
   - Run the master setup script to prepare the directory structure:
     ```bash
     bash master_setup.sh
     ```
   - Make sure all scripts are executable

2. **Configure API access**
   - Set up your OpenAI API key using the API key manager:
     ```bash
     python tools/api_key_manager.py set YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
   - Verify API access is working

3. **Review source material**
   - Ensure all necessary source materials are in the `/original documents` folder
   - Consider adding any additional writing samples if available (character sheets, dialogue examples, etc.)

4. **Prepare and validate dataset**
   - Run the dataset preparation script:
     ```bash
     python scripts/prepare_dataset.py
     ```
   - Validate the generated dataset:
     ```bash
     python scripts/validate_dataset.py datasets/training_finetune_dataset.jsonl --summary
     ```
   - Review the dataset summary to ensure proper distribution of examples

5. **Submit for fine-tuning**
   - Upload the training dataset:
     ```bash
     python scripts/finetune_submit.py upload datasets/training_finetune_dataset.jsonl
     ```
   - Upload the validation dataset:
     ```bash
     python scripts/finetune_submit.py upload datasets/validation_finetune_dataset.jsonl
     ```
   - Submit the fine-tuning job (using the file IDs from the uploads):
     ```bash
     python scripts/finetune_submit.py submit --training-file file-abc123 --validation-file file-def456 --model gpt-3.5-turbo --suffix vendetta-protocol
     ```

6. **Monitor fine-tuning progress**
   - Check the status of your fine-tuning job:
     ```bash
     python scripts/finetune_submit.py monitor YOUR_JOB_ID
     ```
   - Save job details once complete:
     ```bash
     python scripts/finetune_submit.py save-job YOUR_JOB_ID --output output/job_details.json
     ```

7. **Test the fine-tuned model**
   - Use the interactive generation tool to test your model:
     ```bash
     python scripts/generate.py interactive --model YOUR_FINE_TUNED_MODEL_ID
     ```
   - Try different template types to evaluate model performance across categories

## My Tasks:

1. **Available for code refinements**
   - I'll be available to help refine the scripts if you encounter any issues
   - Can assist with debugging data extraction or processing problems

2. **Assist with dataset analysis**
   - Help you interpret the dataset validation results
   - Suggest adjustments to improve category balance if needed

3. **Provide template guidance**
   - Help create additional prompt templates as needed
   - Suggest specific test scenarios based on your writing style

4. **Support troubleshooting**
   - Help diagnose and resolve any API errors
   - Assist with interpreting fine-tuning metrics and results

5. **Evaluation assistance**
   - Help develop evaluation strategies for the fine-tuned model
   - Suggest comparison methodologies between base and fine-tuned models

6. **Documentation updates**
   - Provide any additional documentation needed
   - Help document model capabilities and limitations

## Timeline Considerations:

1. **Dataset preparation**: 1-2 hours depending on source material size
2. **Fine-tuning job**: 2-12 hours (depends on OpenAI queue and dataset size)
3. **Testing and refinement**: 1-2 hours

Remember that fine-tuning is often an iterative process. The first model may need further refinement based on testing results, potentially leading to additional fine-tuning runs with adjusted datasets.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific step in this process?
